# Handling Imbalanced Datasets

This repository demonstrates different techniques to handle imbalanced datasets in machine learning.  
An imbalanced dataset occurs when one class has significantly more samples than the other, which can bias the model.

## 📘 Notebook
- [handling_imbalanced_dataset.ipynb](handling_imbalanced_dataset.ipynb)

## 🛠 Techniques Covered
- Random Oversampling (Upsampling)
- Random Undersampling (Downsampling)
- Risks of Overfitting and Underfitting
- Feature distribution checks after resampling

## ⚙️ Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/handling-imbalanced-datasets.git
